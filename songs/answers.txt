Spotify Wrapped is a feature presenting Spotify users’ 100 most played songs from the past year.
In 2021, Spotify Wrapped calculated an “Audio Aura” for each user, a “reading of [their] two most prominent moods
as dictated by [their] top songs and artists of the year.” Suppose Spotify determines an audio aura by looking at
the average energy, valence, and danceability of a person’s top 100 songs from the past year. In answers.txt,
reflect on the following questions:

If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

I looked up what the meanings were for those items here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features
And read about the Spotify Audio Aura here: https://engineering.atspotify.com/2021/12/the-audio-aura-story-mystical-to-mathematical/

Using that information, I would say the energy is a bit above average, danceability is high, and valence is a bit below average.
There isn't a list of the keywords spotify uses to assign auras, but the higher energy and danceability would make me think of upbeat songs,
however the valence is associated with how "happy" a track sounds, and that is slightly lower than average.

Using the list of audio features from the first link, I think I would also want to consider the instrumentalness, key, and maybe even
loudness to get a better view of the person's listening habits.
